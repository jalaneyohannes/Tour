CISC 480 - Senior Capstone
Spring 2024
Signature Work Portfolio
Due: Friday, 5/24 by 11:59pm
To satisfy the "Signature Work" requirement, you will need to complete an "e-portfolio"
and accompanying "reflection" with the following characteristics:
• The "reflection" should be no less than five pages and describe how the work
included in the "e-portfolio" connects to a problem of interest and to the common
good and/or St. Thomas's mission and values
• The "e-portfolio" should contain at least one piece of work that comes from a
discipline outside of computer science and at least two additional pieces of work
As a computer computer science major, GitHub makes a suitable environment to
develop and host this "e-portfolio". To reasonably accommodate the characteristics
above, I propose the following:
• Use your existing GitHub account and/or create a new GitHub account (potentially
for the purposes of this "e-portfolio")
• Write your "reflection" in either a"README.md" file in your root namespace (your-
github-name/README.md) or in a new repository/project solely for this purpose.
• In your reflection, link to and contextualize at least three GitHub projects that are
either your personal projects, course assignments, or other projects to which you
have contributed (but none of the projects we worked on for this class).
• Your reflection will need to address at least one of the linked projects from a
domain-specific point of view. For example, if you wrote a program to simulate the
behavior of ants, your reflection should spend some time addressing ant behavior.
• Each of the 3+ linked projects should include a project-level "README.md" file that
describes the project and how to run it. I will count each of the linked project
"README.md" files toward the reflection's five page count requirement.
Submission Details
Submit the URL of the GitHub repository that hosts your "reflection" README.md. If
you choose to write your reflection in a separate document, then upload a PDF version
of this document.
